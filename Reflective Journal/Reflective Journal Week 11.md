## Reflective Journal Week 11

### What is your role in the group and has it changed over the semester? If there were any challenges, how did you deal with them?

This is the final week of our group project. All our notebooks, slides, and reports are ready. We feel both excited and nervous about the presentation next week.

Max and I are finalising the last details. We designed the slides to ensure clear communication. A simple layout makes it easy for students and lecturers to follow our "storytelling" of the data.

We reviewed the feedback from our mock presentations. This helped us spot areas for improvement. We checked the notebook and report carefully to ensure every detail is correct. The layout of both the notebook and slides is neat. We also refined small things like indentation, bold text, and decimal places to make everything smooth to read.

As week 12 approaches, the project is almost complete. I feel committed to our work and enjoy the final preparations. I hope we perform well in the presentation next week.
